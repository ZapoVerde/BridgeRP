SHADOW GOVERNANCE REPORT â€” DEFINITION

ðŸ§¾ Purpose The Shadow Governance Report provides a post-facto audit trail for each implemented phase.\
It verifies structural integrity, contract compliance, and implementation coverage across core governance domains â€” without influencing runtime logic.

ðŸ“‚ Location

```
docs/governance_logs/phase_<stage>_<phase>_report.txt
```

Example:

```
docs/governance_logs/phase_01_2_report.txt
```

ðŸ“Œ Trigger\
This report must be created **after the implementation** of any declared Phase Plan.\
It is **mandatory** and precedes final phase acceptance.

ðŸ§± Required Structure Each report must include the following sections:

1. **Symbol Map**

- List all functions, classes, and constants created in the phase
- Include file and line number (if available)
- Exclude test code

2. **Tag Compliance**

- Confirm that all declared functions/classes have a valid `@tags` block
- Confirm that `@tags` are MECE-valid against `tags_vocab.json`
- Confirm `ai_tags` match `@tags` in structure and MECE coverage

3. **Import & Dependency Report**

- List all imports used in phase
- Identify any undeclared dependencies
- Flag any missing or unneeded imports

4. **Test Contract Coverage**

- Confirm that all items in the phaseâ€™s TEST CONTRACT are covered by tests
- If any test path is missing, list it explicitly
- If utility functions are untested, justify as legacy/infra if applicable

5. **Structural Validation**

- Confirm correct use of adapters (if required by plan)
- Confirm no debug violations (e.g., no raw `print()` calls)
- Confirm data flow respects modularity (no backchannel references or leaks)

6. **Observations & Deviations**

- Note any meaningful deviations from the Phase Plan
- Justify architectural exceptions or emergent refactors (if any)

ðŸ”’ Governance Status This report is a **non-negotiable artifact** under the locked governance stack.\
Failure to produce the report invalidates phase acceptance.
