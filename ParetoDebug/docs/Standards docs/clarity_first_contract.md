📘 CLARITY FIRST — SYSTEM-WIDE GOVERNANCE CONTRACT
Version: 1.3
Date Ratified: 2025-07-06
Applies To: All Frame Model phases, actors, and artifacts

────────────────────────────────────────────
🎯 OBJECTIVE
Clarity is a foundational constraint in all human–AI interaction. This contract elevates clarity to the highest level of design consideration.

Clarity enables safe delegation to AI, stable regeneration, and scalable architecture. Without clarity, planning breaks down, implementation misfires, and output diverges.

────────────────────────────────────────────
🔍 1. WHAT IS CLARITY?

Clarity means an artifact can be understood and reconstructed by both human and AI, without hidden context.

An artifact is clear **only if**:

- It has defined boundaries (scope).
- Its name reflects its function.
- It states why it exists (justification).
- It links to its parent structure.
- It can be interpreted and regenerated in isolation.

If two readers disagree about meaning or function, clarity has failed.

🧰 2. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

The Frame Model enforces clarity at each phase through internal constraints:

• MECE tagging: categorizes all entities without overlap
• Skeleton-first: defines structure before content
• Planning loops: isolate ideation from implementation
• Phase plans: define scope, input, and output clearly
• Test contracts: declare expected behavior and edge cases
• ai_tags debugger: adds traceable runtime clarity
• Shadow governance: audits compliance after generation

🚫 3. HOW CLARITY FAILS

Clarity breaks when:

- 🚨 **Invalid Assumption Execution** — The AI proceeds on low-confidence input or ambiguous conditions without surfacing or resolving uncertainty
- **Scope Drift** — The item includes unrelated or unclearly bound content
- **Name Conflict** — The name overlaps or contradicts others
- **Missing Justification** — No explanation is given for inclusion
- **Unlinked Artifact** — No connection to a structural parent
- **Hidden Context Dependency** — Meaning relies on external memory or assumptions
- **Premature Fusion** — Multiple ideas combined before atomic clarity

────────────────────────────────────────────
🏗️ 4. STRUCTURAL RESPONSIBILITIES

The system must:

1. Trace every artifact to a parent. No orphans allowed.
2. Forbid unnamed or untied functions.
3. Guarantee deterministic regeneration from known inputs.
4. Isolate unclear ideas until resolved.
5. Require justification for all inclusions.

────────────────────────────────────────────
🛡️ 5. CRITICAL CONTRACTUAL IMPORTANCE

Clarity is a **foundational design value** of human–AI collaboration. It must be preserved across all planning, architecture, and implementation phases.

All artifacts and decisions should aim to maximize clarity wherever possible. When ambiguity, complexity, or tradeoffs arise:

> Pause and ask: *Is this clear enough to safely delegate or regenerate?*

Clarity may not override every other principle, but it must always be **considered** before proceeding.
